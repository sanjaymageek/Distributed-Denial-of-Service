# Distributed-Denial-of-Service  
Analyzing Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning and deep learning techniques has become crucial in cybersecurity. Machine learning algorithms enable real-time identification of attack patterns and anomalies in network traffic, while deep learning enhances detection accuracy by extracting intricate features. This integration allows for attack classification, differentiation between legitimate and malicious traffic, and dynamic adaptation to evolving threats. Leveraging these advanced techniques empowers cybersecurity professionals to proactively defend against DDoS attacks, ensuring uninterrupted access to critical services.
